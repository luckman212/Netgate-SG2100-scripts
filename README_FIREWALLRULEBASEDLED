Drifting off into dream land ....

It's 11pm and someone turns on a gaming system, you know this individual has a test or maybe a soccer game tomorrow, all the sudden your firewall'a state established LED turn on and glows red.

I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the TV I flew like a flash, tore open the door, and went with dash. When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, 
the little one again with game controller in hand. Now little one you stand with a solemn face... go to bed ! Go to bed! Go back to bed now!"

Reality is:
You can also make the LED change to red based on firewall rules when they are live, take for example when running the following command inside of shell

pfctl -vvsr

This displays all the rule IDs, the rule I want to use for my system is 79 it is a gaming system. What I want to happen is the led change to on when that game system has an active state.

pfctl -vvss will display all active states

I want to check only on rule 79 so we grep it

pfctl -vvss | grep ', rule 79'

So now that I know this works and it matches the system I need

I go into the fireall GUI and creat a file mine is /root/deviceonline

add the following code

#!/bin/sh
pfctl -vvss | grep ', rule 79' >/dev/null
res=$?
if [ $res = 0 ]; then
  sysctl -q dev.gpio.2.led.2.pwm=1
  gpioctl -f /dev/gpioc2 6 duty 1 >/dev/null
fi


after chmod it 

chmod +x /root/deviceonline

and add a chron job to run when needed..

When this rule goes active the LED will change state to red
